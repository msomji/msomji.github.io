Before I applying to DBC, I spent a lot of time reading multiple reviews and blogs about the program to determine if it is something that would actually be a good fit for me and worthwhile to attend. It is safe to say that I fell in love with the atmosphere that DBC promotes almost immidiately. Current students in the program and various alumni all seemed to promote the same message that reminds everyone that it’s called a “boot-camp” for a reason. After listening to the fireside chat with Shereef I found that his underlying message is that your DBC experience is in YOUR control. You are not the customer but actually the chef in the kitchen learning and perfecting various different entrees for the very first time! The work hard play hard mentality is truly magnetic and I know that anyone who goes through the program with this mentality is setting themselves up for success.

Honestly, I am a little intimidated by what is to come in the coming weeks however I know that I learn most effectively under this kind of environment. So far my expectations of DBC have not changed much in terms of the type of challenges that we have been working on. I was however surprised by the amount of writing and reflections that had to be completed this week. Initially I was not looking forward to this but as I went through each challenge and its respective reflection I found that the reflection was extremely helpful in highlighting what I was learning and it also made it easier to recall the skills and apply them to future challenges.

Overall I am super excited to be apart of this group and am looking forward to get to know everyone I can get into contact with. I wouldn’t say I am nervous but rather curious to find out how much I can actually learn in the next 18 weeks!
