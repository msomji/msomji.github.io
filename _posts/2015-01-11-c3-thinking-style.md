“If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking”- George Patton.

Programming is certainly not an exact art, and therefore majority of it is done in groups of two or more individuals. Group members come together and brain storm their ideas with each other to determine what would be the most efficient method to complete the task at hand. In order to be effective as a group it is vital for each individual to both know how they think and also communicate to the team so everyone knows that too. This not only allows the team members to communicate with each other in the manner they would understand the most effectively, but it also allows them to be able to assign tasks to each individual more effectively based off of both their strengths and the way the perceive things. A team with individuals who think differently can really work to their advantage by potentially making them more effective and may also help in avoiding misunderstandings.

You must be wondering: “I wonder what kind of thinking styles there are?” Well…

Dr. Anthony Gregorc, a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Connecticut has identified that there are four specific categories of preferred thinking types.

- Concrete Sequential thinking style: Such individuals tend to be very logical thinkers and depend mainly on a logical and ordered process.

- Concrete Random Thinkers: Such thinkers enjoy experimenting what their tasks to reach the desired destination.

- Abstract Random thinkers: Such random thinker are more so visual reflectors but strive in an unstructured environment

- Abstract sequential thinkers These individuals depend on theories and usually use abstract ideas to complete their projects.

Despite the different types of thinking styles, it is important to remember that neither one outweighs the other, each are just as good as their counter parts, they just use a different methods to reach the same destination.

I took the Gregorc’s test to determine my thinking style a couple weeks ago which determined that I am abstract random thinker. When I took the test, this did not come to me as a surprise. Having this information though is a huge advantage as I now know what kind of environment I need to be able to think the most effectively. This will make working with others a lot easier as I will be able to communicate very simply my thinking style to other members.

Another important factor that determines how efficient we are at what we do, is knowing how we learn and having the correct mindset. Dr. Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford spear headed the research done in this field and determined that there are two separate types of mindsets, fixed and growth mindsets. As I am more of a visual learner, below is a picture that compares the two mindsets with each other.

I know that I certainly have a few fixed mindset tendencies but luckily, as I continue to develop and learn new skills I can influence and change my mindset to become more of a growth mindset. Certainly knowing my shortcomings is the first step to becoming a better learner.

So far the phase 0 experience has only been getting better. Though the challenges are starting to demand both more time and thinking, I believe that I have been able to set a particular routine in place to allow myself to successfully cover the assignments and also give my self enough time to dig deeper in more specific topics of more interest to me personally.
