Nothing in this world is perfect but the least we can do is to strive for the best. Like in any workplace, there is a lot of space for improvement. One of the most significant problems noticed in the tech world is the drastic population difference between men and women in the workplace. To take Apple inc. as an example, As of 2014, about 70% of Apple employees were male (Hawver, 2014). However, though this imbalance between the sexes has been an ongoing discussion in most workplaces, it is most prominent in the tech world.

It may seem obvious why there is such a large gender difference in the tech world however there is absolutely no excuse for it. Many comunities within the tech world are playing an active role to find a solution to eliminate this imbalance and though the imbalance has been improved over the years, we still have a lot of room for improvement.

With Boot-camps such as DBC and others that provide special schollarships for minorities and women, I do believe that we are on the right path to the solution. By advertising more jobs directed towards women and also incentivizing companies to maintain a balanced ratio between the two sexes will also eventually allow us to fix this bug perminantly
