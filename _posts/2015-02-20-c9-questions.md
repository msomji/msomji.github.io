I am certain that while growing up everyone had that class where participation was part of the grade. As annoying as those classes were, they were structured in that manner because asking and answering questions are extremely important tools that one needs to be able to utilize effectively in any career they pursue. Upon reading a couple other blogs on our most dearest internet I have come up with a few key factors that you should consider when asking a question.

The first key factor is that you need to be specific. Make sure that your question gives enough specifics so that it is absolutely clear what kind of information you are looking for in return. This strategy will not only save a lot of time, it will also make it less frustrating for the individual who is trying to answer the question as they will know right off the bat what the confusion is.
This may be trivial however it is quite a common occurrence. The name of the game is to make sure the question is packed with enough information and context to minimize others responding to your question with a question.

This brings me to my next point of providing context. In the tech world it can get confusing very quickly if you use just use your words, don’t be afraid to throw in some code into our question it will not only allow people to see what exactly you are talking about but they will also be able to potentially help refactor that particular snippet of code. It is important to be specific when throwing in some code, use tools such as syntax-highligher to make it visual and also only include the code in question and not the entire document.

Become a grammer Nazi! With English not being my first language I still struggle with this but with the help of spell-check in Word, I am usually able to eliminate any major errors. re-read your question atlas twice to make sure that it makes sense and that there are not major grammar error. Unless you are in an English Literature class you don’t need to go over board with this however make sure that it is understandable.

Thats it! once you have these key factors in place, you should have a solid question. Now just before you actually ask the question do a quick test and pretend you are answering that question, would you know how to answer it? Do you know what the question is specifically asking? Does the question make sense? If you answer yes to all of these, you should be good to go!

Now that you are a master at questioning, go ahead and ask away!
