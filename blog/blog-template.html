    <p>Web design and drawing have a lot in common. Both include creating shapes, manipulating said shapes and then ordering the shapes in patterns that create the end product. While drawing in the traditional manner, once drawn, shape remains in a fixed position until it is either covered by another shape or erased. On the other hand, web design tends to be a little more volatile as it allows the shape to move and interact with the user depending on their actions..<a href="t2-css-design.html">continue reading</a></p>

      <h1>Phase 0: Week 1 Unit 1</h1>
  <h2>What on Earth is Git/Github?</h2>

Right off the bat I fell in love with the atmosphere that DBC promotes. Current student in the program and various alumni all seemed to promote the same message that reminds everyone that it’s called a “boot camp” for a reason. After listening to the fireside chat with Shereef I found that his underlying message is that your DBC experience is in <strong>YOUR</strong> control. You are not the customer but actually the chef in the kitchen learning and perfecting various different entrees for the very first time! The work hard play hard mentality is truly magnetic and I know that anyone who goes through the program with this mentality is setting themselves up for success...<a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">continue reading</a> </p>
