      <h1>Phase 0: Week 1 Unit 1</h1>
  <h2>What on Earth is Git/Github?</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>12/14/14</h4>

  <section>
    <p>A lot of information was covered this week, much of which was completely new to me.  We were introduced to a version control software known as git which is fairly straight forward once you get a hang of using it a couple times. Git allows individuals to develop their programs and save them as they move through the project. This save feature is known as version control which allows the developer to not only save their present code but git actually keeps record of each save allowing the developer of others to examine the code before each save.</p>

    <p>Many developers use version control because it allows for transparency. With version control not only can one retrace their work and thought process through a project but others can also observe the changes and understand what the developer was thinking at the time. Version control is vital to programming because there are usually many different ways to develop a certain program and with version control it allows multiple developers to contribute to determine the most efficient code.</p>

    <p>In order to make git accessible to the vast majority, developers use github that does exactly what it suggests. Github acts as a hub that holds the master copy of the program where others can have access to it and copy it to their own local machines to make edits and then later save it back on github for others to once again have access to examine the new edits. In addition to this, github also allows multiple individuals to work on the same copy of the program simultaneously that they can later submit to github and add the changes to the master copy.</p>

      <p>Before I applied to DBC, I spent a lot of time reading reviews and blogs about the program to determine if it is something that would actually be both a good fit for me and worthwhile to attend. Right off the bat I fell in love with the atmosphere that DBC promotes. Current student in the program and various alumni all seemed to promote the same message that reminds everyone that it’s called a “boot camp” for a reason. After listening to the fireside chat with Shereef I found that his underlying message is that your DBC experience is in <strong>YOUR</strong> control. You are not the customer but actually the chef in the kitchen learning and perfecting various different entrees for the very first time! The work hard play hard mentality is truly magnetic and I know that anyone who goes through the program with this mentality is setting themselves up for success. </p>
<p>Honestly, I am a little intimidated by what is to come in the coming weeks however I know that I learn the most under this kind of environment because there is always something that needs to get done. So far my expectations of DBC have not changed much in terms of the type of challenges that we were expected to complete so far. I was however surprised by the amount of writing and reflections that had to be completed this week. Initially I was not looking forward to this but as I went through each challenge and its respective reflection I found that the reflection was extremely helpful in highlighting what I was learning and it also made it easier to recall the skills and apply them to future challenges. </p>
<p>Overall I am super excited to be apart of this group and am looking forward to get to know everyone I can get into contact with. I wouldn’t say I am nervous but rather curious to find out how much I can actually learn in the next 18 weeks!</p>
